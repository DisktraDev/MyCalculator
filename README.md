# My-Calculator
A simple calculator android application for learning purposes.

##Â Add an API key
To use the application, you'll need to register a free API key from [this site](https://www.abstractapi.com/exchange-rate-api). Once you got it, create a new `apikey.properties` file at the root of the project with the following content:

`API_KEY="yourApiKey"`

Then build the project. Enjoy !
